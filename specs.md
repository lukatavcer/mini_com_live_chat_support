Frontend Coding Challenge: MiniCom - Live Chat Support Demo (Revised)

Tech Stack:
- React (Hooks + Context or Zustand)
- Next.js (App Router)
- Tailwind CSS

Scenario
You are building a live customer support system, similar to Intercom or Drift.

Goal
Build a MiniCom prototype that demonstrates realtime chat, scalable UI, and clean architecture.

Visitor App Requirements (Mock Website)
1) A mock website with a chat widget that opens from a bottom-right button.
2) A visitor can start a conversation via the chat widget.
3) Chat interface with:
    - Message bubbles
    - Scrollable history
    - Auto-scroll on new message

Agent App Requirements (Standalone App)
1) Agent inbox with:
    - All open conversations
    - Unread counts
    - Last message preview
    - Sort by recent and unread
2) Thread view where the agent can open a conversation and respond.

Shared Requirements
1) Cross-app messaging
    - Visitor messages appear in the agent app inbox
    - Agent responses are delivered back to the visitor chat widget
2) Realtime constraints
    - Optimistic send
    - Retry on failure
    - Out-of-order message handling
    - Delivery states: sending, sent, failed
    - Realtime transport can be simulated (BroadcastChannel, localStorage events, polling) or implemented via a managed service (Firebase/Supabase)
3) Presence and typing indicators
    - Simulated is OK
    - Debounced updates
4) Data model
    - Define thread, participant, message, metadata
    - Include timestamps, status, read receipts
5) Accessibility
    - Keyboard navigation for input and inbox list (agent app)
    - Visible focus states
    - ARIA labels for key controls
6) Performance
    - Virtualized list OR lazy rendering for long histories
7) Tests (minimum 3)
    - One UI interaction
    - One state transition
    - One edge case
8) Resilience
    - Error boundary or offline banner
    - Defined fallback behavior
9) Responsive UI using Tailwind CSS.
10) Clean code, reusable components (atomic design or component library is OK), and a clear folder structure.

Bonus Points
- Persist threads (localStorage or backend)
- Notification badge or sound on new message
- Dark mode toggle

AI Usage (Allowed)
This challenge is AI-friendly. If you use AI tools, document it clearly.

README Requirements
- Project overview
- Architecture diagram (text is fine)
- State management choices and trade-offs
- How AI helped (include example prompts and what you edited)
- Improvements you would make with more time

Submission Checklist
- GitHub repo link
- Live demo link (Vercel, Netlify, etc.)
- README.md with all required sections
